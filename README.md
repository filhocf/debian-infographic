From Wikipedia: “Infographics are visual representations of information. 
These charts are used where information needs to be explained in a more 
dynamic, such as maps, journalism and technical manuals, educational or 
scientific purposes.”

So I made my first infographic on Debian, which sought to put all the 
information (possible) I have in my lecture on this great project. What 
motivated me to make this stuff was the difficulty that the general public 
has to understand Debian, its areas, their numbers or their general operation.

This motivation took place after seeing some infographics, i follow some time, 
especially after Fa Conti, another passionate person, began to flood with 
posts of great material on several subjects.

Now, is to evolve it and think about the next. ;-)

The first acceptable release was the version 0.7, so the CHANGELOG begins
since this version.
